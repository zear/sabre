First off ... 
This port of Sabre to SDL is the sole responsibility of David Vandewalle. 
Home : <vandewal@skyblue.com> or 
Work : <david.e.vandewalle@lmco.com>

Bugging the other authors about things that go wrong with this port would be
a BadThing(tm).  (In other words, DON'T FLAME DAN HAMMER IF THIS DIES ON YOU!)

All troubles with this should be sent to ME.  I an open for suggestions,
bugs, etc.  All flames go to /dev/null with no reply, so don't bother.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

other things ...
This was a quick dirty (1hr) hack.  It seems to work OK for me. It is NOT very
well integrated with the svgalib version in that you cannot build either
version from the same source tree right now.  This is gonna change when I
get some more free time.

You kinda need SDL to use this.  You can get SDL from
http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/

This port was done with the latest greatest CVS tree beta.

My platform is Linux. (AMD K6-233 / RedHat 5.1 - I use egcs1.0.2)  On other SDL platforms, your 
mileage may vary.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Notes about SDL ...
SDL is setup to run Sabre in a X window.  SDL has a fullscreen mode that has
faster blits, but you can't see the cursor!  As soon as I add some code to
bind the cursor to the window, I will add a fullscreen option or something. 
Fullscreen does require you to be root though ...

The RunSabre scripts still work!!  This is how you set the X window size. 
Sabre doens't really know it isn't still in vga mode, it just gets whatever
mode you specify as an X window ...

In 320x200 mode I average 17 frames per sec
In 640x480 mode I average 6 frames per sec
In 800x600 mode ... well we won't go there!

Note that this is running on a 16 bit X display!  
SDL has some palette mode options I still need to screw with.  I don't think
the  blit speed is the deciding factor on the frame rate however ... 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


changes from the svgalib Sabre ...
very few. 

I changed three files in the Sabre src directory.
these are: input.C
           kbdhit.C
           vga_13.C

I moved the fontdev.C and fontdev.h files from the gdev directory into the 
main src directory (and changed the Makefile.am).  I changed fontdev.h SLIGHTLY 
by commenting the include of gdev.h  This was done because gdev needs svgalib, 
and the whole idea of this was to get rid of svgalib.  Moving this over made 
everything fairly seamless ...


----------------------------------------------------------------------------


know bugs ...
sometimes mouse clicks are missed/queued till the next click.  I gotta hack
at this some more, current mouse click IO is kinda kludgy.

This isn't really MY problem, but I found it while doing this ... the MetroX
server that shipped with RedHat 5.0 and version 4.3.0 have a bug in DGA
mode.  The newer versions of SDL can work around this somewhat now ...


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


future (when I find some time)...
Sound!!  I NEED to here those wonderful .50's when I hose a target!!

Rewrite the heavy routines in asm with MMX.  I profiled this thing, and
found what I need to do, now I just gotta do it ... :-P 

Add code for 16 bit color??

Maybe an F-22 plane just for fun if I get really bored at work ...  Gotta have 
my baby! (F-22 -vs- MIG-15, hmmmm ... MIG sucks down an AMRAAM ... :-)
