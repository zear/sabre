OPERATING SYSTEM

 SABRE is running currently under Unix systems; 
 the Linux version 2.0+ to be more precise. 
 
 SABRE gets compiled best with GCC 2.7.2.1+
 
LIBRARIES

 SABRE uses vga for graphics output and currently 
 is tied to SVGAlib. The version 1.2.10 will do fine.

 The frontend needs dialog program which is provided in
 separate dialog directory. Dialog is ncurses based and will
 work with ncurses 1.9.4

 The (simulator) sources are all c++ so libg++ is needed
 in order to build sabre binary; libg++.so.2.7.2.1 will suffice
 for that.
 
 Other libraries that may effect are:
 
 libstdc++.so.27 => /usr/libstdc++.so.27.2.1
 libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5.0.7
 libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.4.17
 
 Earlier versions may cause SABRE malfunctions.
 
HARDWARE

 I guess any system that excepts vga based adapter supported by
 SVGAlib will do.
 
 SABRE has been tested in following systems:
 
 Intel Pentium 150,166Mhz
 Alpha 21066   166Mhz

MAINTAINER TOOLS

 In order to make distributions or other maintaing on sabre tree one
 needs perl, automake (1.2) and autoconf (2.12). 
 (please contact the author, Dan Hammer <dan@cobite.com> before making
  distributions that goes publicly available)
