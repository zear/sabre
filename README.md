GCW Zero port of Sabre by Artur "zear" Rojek

In order to compile:
```
cd ./sabre/
make
cd ./sdlsrc/
cp ../src/main.C
make
```

GCW Zero release files are in ./opk/

Please note that in order to port Sabre to GCW Zero, input code had to be hacked.
Ports to non-handheld platforms should use the original code instead.
