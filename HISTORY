Version 0.1.2 April, 1997
-------------------------	
Initial release


Version 0.2.0 August, 1997
--------------------------
The most notable difference is ... the ground varies in
height! There are hills, and valleys, and roads, and even
farm-fields (or so they can be imagined as). 

Better-looking smoke trails from destroyed planes.

Texture-mapped planes now look a tad more acceptable.

New plane - the Yak-9.


Version 0.2.1 September, 1997
-----------------------------

Properly done configuration and make files. A nicely done
front-end script contributed by Antti Barck, RunSabre.

You should find SABRE to run a good 15% faster. I discovered some
misjudgements in terms of evaluating objects for inclusion in
the drawing que (oh, to be honest, they were more like dumb
mistakes), and once corrected,  for myself and others there was
a definite improvement in frame-rate. (You can see the frame-rate
in the front cockpit view via the '|' key).

New plane - The F-84 ThunderJet!

Cleaned up some of the pilot's lingo. Embarassingly, they were
saying things like "Kill on MiG-15 @ Angels 12567", when the term
"Angels" refers to feet in thousands, so they should have said
(and will say now) " ... Angels 12".


Version 0.2.2 December, 1997
----------------------------

NEW SVGALIB VIDEO MODES -- AND WINDOWS
You now have several svgalib video modes to
choose from - ranging from the classic but admittedly
pixely G320x200x256 up to the incredibly sharp and 
(and incredibly slow in Full Screen) G1024x768x256. 
In addition to choosing the mode, which determines the
screen resolution, you can also select varying sized 
"windows" so you can balance image-size vs speed.
For example, you can choose svgamode G600X400X256 with a
320x200 window, or G800X600X256 with a 512x300 window,
etc.

Modes and windows are selectable via the RunSabre script,
or through the -mode <0|1|2|3> -window <width> <height>
parameters. 

Note: the cockpit graphic will appear only in a 320x200 window.

HIT LOGIC
Good news and bad news. The good news is ... hits are now accurately
determined. The bad news is ... I can't get any anymore!

GROUND UNITS
Ground-units with a mean disposition ... try out the "gru" mission,
heading for the grey circular area below you. They can't shoot very
well, but they sure try!  

TEXTURE MAPPING
A little bit of fussing with the texture-mapping routines eliminated
a lot of the "cracks" that were appearing. Unfortunately, the textures
still seem to "wobble" a bit too much. Nice clouds!

VGA_GETKEY()
keyboard input improved with use of vga_getkey()

JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO
FLY AGAIN ...
The computer pilots have had a major attitude change. They refuse to
be hampered by the so-called "laws of physics", which, as all you
deconstructionists know, is a mere artifact of our particular social
order. The computer pilots are now free of the bonds of momentum
and inertia, and having reached this higher plateau of reality,
can send bullets your way pretty much whenever they want to.

BROWSE THE WEB AGAIN ...

Version 0.2.3  April, 1998
---------------------------------
AIR-TO-GROUND
I've been focusing on the ground-attack
portion of the game with this release.
In several missions, you can now select
rockets and bombs via the 'n' key,
and attack not-completely-helpless ground
targets.  

The "gru<n>" (gru,gru2,gru3) missions involve
varying levels of ground action, with perhaps
some MiGs running interference or seeking pay-back.
All the missions will start you off pointed in the right
direction, with ground targets being present in or
around the dark circular patch of ground in front
of you ("Target Range Omega").  

In these missions, you will encounter
anti-aircraft fire. If you notice puffy little
orange and white clouds appearing outside your
window, it might be time to jink a wee bit before you
are blown to kingdom-come!

Further information can be gotten from doc/gru.txt
about these new missions.

WHEN YOU GET HIT
When your plane has taken its maximum damage, you will
find yourself outside in the "flyby" view, watching your
plane spinning and burning away from you. You can climb
back in and ride her down if you feel like by using
the normal view keys, but if I were you, I'd just stay
suspended in the air. 


Version 0.2.4 January, 1999
------------------------------------------------
 X-WINDOWS SDL VERSION
Thanks to David Vandewalle, who has provided
a version which can be compiled with the SDL
API so that Sabre can be run in an X-Window!

Check out the sdlsrc directory for a Makefile
and READMEs!


NEW KEYS
Sorry ... some changes in the key usage had to
be made. Consult docs/keys.txt, or, even better,
take a gander at sbrkeys.C, which you can alter
and recompile as you wish! For those with Real
Men's fingers, you can now fly via the keyboard:
'i' -- nose up
'm' -- nose down
'j' -- bank left
'l' -- bank right
'k' -- center yoke

NEW ARTIFICIAL DUMBS
Those wascally computer pilots have entirely new brains,
consisting of much prettier code, although it doesn't 
seem they fly much prettier as a result. Be careful going
head-to-head with these guys! 

NEW VIEWS
Virtual cockpit
Wow! A virtual cockpit, just like a REAL flight sim!
Key '0' for the virtual cockpit ... 's' rotates left,
'S' rotates right, 'd' rotates down, 'D' rotates up,
and ')' snaps you to the front.

Padlock view
Wow! A padlock view, just like a REAL flight sim!
Select a target, and key '&' to enter the padlock view. 
Not very easy to control the plane in this view, for sure!


NOT NEW, BUT WORTH MENTIONING
If Sabre runs a tad slow for you, due to my over-worked
and under-optimized graphic routines, you can boost the 
frame rate by turning off clouds and texture mapped
terrain via the "%" and "^" keys.
