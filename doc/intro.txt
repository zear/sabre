                             INTRODUCTION

SABRE Fighter Plane Simulator is an on-going game project for
Linux, under the GNU Public License. It is being worked on as
a labor of love by flight-simulation enthusiasts. Being in an early
stage, there is a tremendous amount of interesting work to be done 
by those who would find it rewarding. Please refer to the README
and the TODO file for additional information regarding contributions.

This documentation is by no means complete nor totally accurate. 
Probably of most use is "keys.txt", which describes the various
key functions. That particular document will be kept updated as much
as possible. 

MISSIONS/SCENARIOS
The ./scenarios directory contains several mission and demo scripts.
They are most easily accessed by using the RunSabre front-end
script, but can also be run from the command line from the top of
the distribution directory by 
# ./scenarios/<scenario you would like to try>
 
Here is a not necessarily complete list of the current set of
missions with a brief description. It's worth running the more
populated missions in "demo" mode by appending a "-demo" in
the above command line, or better by simply choosing the "demos"
menu in the RunSabre script. The "demo" mode operates in a hands-off
manner, switching view-point from plane to plane to give you a
"God's-Eye" view of the battle.

There also are additional document files which will give a more
detailed explanation and instructions relating to a particular 
mission/scenario.

   fly       
   Your basic fly-around-and-shoot-at-stuff-on-the-ground introductory
   mission. Crashing is turned off, though, so kamikaze attacks are
   ruled out.

   takeoff
   Starts you off sitting on the runway, cleared for takeoff. Hit "*" to
   make throttle 100%. Hit "w" to release wheel-brakes. When your airpseed
   gets to 160 (upper left readout), pull up and God help you.

   shoot1
   Puts you right behind a rather clueless MiG-15. Just squeeze the trigger
   you can't miss!

   shoot2
   Like above, except this time the MiG will break left or right.

   shoot3
   Like above, except the MiG will "jink" 
   
   dogfight
   Its you versus a hot MiG-15 pilot who wants to help you die
   for your country. Random setup, and this time the MiG ain't gonna
   be dancing!

   furball
   6 Sabres and 3 Mustangs versus 6 MiG-15s and 3 Yak-9s.  
   The scenario starts out with everyone scattered randomly about
   the sky. It ends with everyone scattered randomly on the ground. 

   melee
   5 Sabres head straight into 5 MiG-15s. 

   yakattak
   An F-51 Mustang duels with a Yak-9. 

   migjump
   You and your wing-comrade, Commander Jing, jump 3 F-51 Mustangs 
   in your MiG-15s. Use 'zoom and boom' tactics to defeat the less
   powerful American planes.

   thunder
   Three F-84 Thunderjets encounter a flight of MiG-15s. You'll need 
   to use your better training and skill to overcome the performance
   advantage the MiGs possess over the Thunderjet. 

   pistons
   The last hurrah for piston engine powered fighters. F-51 Mustangs
   face off against Yak-9s.

   gru
   The beginnings of a ground-attack aspect to the game. Strafe ground
   targets in your F-84 ThunderJet with guns, rockets and bombs 
   (head towards the dark-grey circular area below you).
   The '^' key cycles through your weapons. 

Enjoy, and Check Six!
