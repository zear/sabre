                    Statement of Conscience
This program is not intended to advocate war. The author is not 
a member of nor connected to any military or paramilitary
group. The simulation of flying and air combat is a fascinating 
and rewarding challenge as it involves so many areas of human 
knowledge. However, it can never be stated too strongly that the
horror inflicted upon real human beings by real weapons of war
is abhorrent. The Korean War, the aircraft and weapons of which this
mission simulates, devastated the beautiful Korean peninsula and took 
millions of lives. Keep in mind that real men, women and children suffered 
and died in that conflict. That being said, it is also well to keep in
mind the sacrifice of those Americans who, for our sake, fought in that war.
It doesn't seem to this author a hypocrisy to be appalled by war, but
still honour those men and women who gave their time, blood, limbs and
life in the belief that they were preserving our liberty and life.
Please enjoy the game, as a game, and let no one ever have to play 
such a game for real again.
