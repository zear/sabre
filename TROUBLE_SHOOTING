TROUBLE SHOOTING
  Here's some common problems that have been reported, with 
  some solutions suggested:


"NOT RUNNING IN GRAPHICS-CAPABLE VIRTUAL CONSOLE"
-----------------------------------------------
You are in some kind of GUI environment, probably X11/fvwm. 
You need to be in console mode to run SABRE. To get to 
console mode in fvwm, <CTL><ALT><F2> (or <F3> ... etc)
will get you there. Login and come back to the SABRE
installation directory.


"SVGALIB: CANNOT GET I/O PERMISSIONS"
-----------------------------------
This means that you are not running SABRE as root, nor have you
set the "uid" bit on the sabre binary. Svgalib needs to run as root
in order to access the video hardware. Either become user root, or,
as user root: 
$ chmod a+s src/sabre
will allow SABRE to work with non-root users.


MOUSE DOESN'T WORK
------------------
  Make sure that your libvga is configured for your kind of mouse. Edit
  the file /etc/vga/libvga.config and select the appropriate mouse
  type by uncommenting the correct line:

	# Mouse type:

	# mouse Microsoft	# Microsoft
	# mouse MouseSystems	# Mouse Systems
	# mouse MMSeries	# Logitech MM Series
	# mouse Logitech	# Logitech protocol (old, newer mice use Microsoft protocol)
	# mouse Busmouse	# Bus mouse
	# mouse PS2		# PS/2 mouse
	# mouse MouseMan	# Logitech MouseMan
	# mouse none		# None

Microsoft and PS2 are the most common types.  


ARROW KEYS DON'T WORK
---------------------
The arrow keys are not currently trapped for. Reason being they
give off different codes depending on the particular termcap file you
have. 

Version 0.2.4 supports the following keys to control the yoke:
'i' -- nose up
'm' -- nose down
'j' -- bank left
'l' -- bank right
'k' -- center yoke

JOYSTICK DOESN'T WORK
---------------------
If you are not using the joystick.0.8.0 package, see
JOYSTICK.README, as that is the package currently supported.


ERROR BUILDING DIALOGSRC
------------------------
Older versions of "/usr/include/curses.h" give this compile error:

In file included from checklist.c:23:
dialog.h:122: parse error before `use_colors'
dialog.h:122: warning: data definition has no type or storage class

Try getting a more recent version of the curses library. To check,
/usr/include/curses.h should contain the following define:
...
#define NCURSES_VERSION "1.9.9e"
...
