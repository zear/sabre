INSTALLING
  Please see the file README for system requirements.

  In the great GNU/Linux tradition, you install SABRE by compiling it
  via the ./configure and make commands. For those who wish, precompiled
  binaries are available at http://sabre.cobite.com, follow the 
  "Download Sabre" link.   

  You install sabre by first running the configure script in this
  directory. This script will check your system for all necessary
  components to build and run SABRE. 

  If no errors are reported by configure, you may then proceed
  to run make.
  
  The commands are simply:
	
  # ./configure<ENTER>
  # make<ENTER>

  Because SABRE makes use of the svga library, it must be run as user
  root. If you wish to have non-root users run SABRE, then the 'setuid'
  bit must be set. The installation does NOT do this automatically,
  you must do it by hand. Here are the commands:

  # su<ENTER>   
  (... enter the password for root)
  # chown root src/sabre<ENTER>
  # chmod a+s src/sabre<ENTER>
  
  The current version of SABRE installs itself only in this distribution
  directory, and should be run from this directory. 

  For a quick test, get into a "console screen", cd to this directory,
  and 
  # ./fly
  Should have you in your North American Sabrejet.

  For a more extensive experience,
  # ./RunSabre
  Is a snappy, menu-driven script which will introduce you to various
  missions, demos and docs.
  

OPTIMIZING BY HAND
  Version 0.2.2d Note:
  The current installation attempts to give you the best optimization
  flags via the "cflags" script. The following instructions are for
  those who wish to try different optimization schemes. 


  
  If you want to make faster binary, you may want to turn off debugging 
  and raise optimization level. Then you just issue:
  
  # CFLAGS=-O4 CXXFLAGS=-O4 ./configure

  For Intel Pentium machines you might get best results by:
  
  # CFLAGS="-Wall -O6 -m486" CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O6 -m486"  ./configure
  
  and for Digital Alpha you should have:
  
  # CFLAGS="-Wall -O2"  CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O2" ./configure
  
  or even:
  
  # CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -D__risc_cpu"  CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -D__risc_cpu" ./configure
  
  (__risc_cpu is recognized somewhere in the sources to speed up Alpha
   execution)
  
  As Intel Pentiums hides RISC core under existing x86 command set, you
  might like to try:
  
  # CFLAGS="-Wall -O6 -m486 -D__risc_cpu"  CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O6 -m486 -D__risc_cpu" ./configure
  
  SABRE is quite Linux oriented thing due the use of svgalib. The switches
  here have been thought from the gcc point of view.
