For those who are interested, pretty much ANYTHING
you think of will most likely be needed. Just check with
me (dan@cobite.com) in case someone else happens to be doing
the same thing. At any rate, the following list is neither
exhaustive nor in any order of importance.

********************************************
* C++ coding kind-of-stuff                 *
********************************************
* SOUND
  Goes without saying! 

* PLAY-BACK
  A big thing in the fsim world is being able to "play-back"
  a mission so that your friends, children and grandchildren can
  witness your brilliant maneuvering. SABRE could use such
  a "play-back" feature.

* NETWORKING
  Player-v-player is sorely needed. 

* MISSION SCRIPTING
  A user-friendly way of generating missions/scenarios would
  be handy!  

* GENERAL ALL-AROUND HACKING
   ... is encouraged. If you come up with something
  cool, let me know!

*******************************************
* Graphics painting kind-of-stuff         *
*******************************************
* COCKPIT GRAPHICS
  SABRE is in serious need of some nicely rendered cockpits. 
  So far the planes represented are the F-86 SabreJet, F-84
  ThunderJet, F-51 Mustang, MiG-15 and the Yak-9. Also on
  the boards will be the B-29.

  The cockpits need to use a gray palette of 29 shades, and
  of course be no more than 300X200 pixels in dimension
  (it wouldn't hurt to cut the height a little, to say, 160
   pixels).  

*******************************************
* Flight modeling physics kind-of-stuff   *
*******************************************
* FLIGHT MODELING
  As some have pointed out, the flight-modeling is probably
  the area where the most improvement could be made. Not being
  an aerodynamic-engineer, or for that manner, an anything-engineer,
  I did the best I could. I asked my father the physicist to help, 
  but his specialty is tiny lasers, so no luck there. 
  So any pointers, comments, criticisms, or better still, 
  algorythms and actual breathing code, from those who know better
  would be gratefuly (and humbly) accepted. Check flight.C for
  the Flight Model code.
